### New Feature: **üèÖ Golden player.**

#### 2024-12-03

I often wonder who the most promising players are in my team for a specific position, and who currently has the highest ability rating.

This feature sets a gold medal marker for the player with the highest ability or potential in a specific position, making it easy for you to notice them quickly.

In fact, we will set markers for the top three players in a position, which are gold, silver, and bronze medals.
